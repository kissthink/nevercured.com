The Recovery Partnership</h1>

February 18</h2>


<p id="jft_excerpt">
As long as I take it easy and make a commitment with my Higher Power to do the best I can, I know I will be taken care of today<em>
Basic Text, p. 120</em>
</p>


<p>Many of us feel that our fundamental commitment in recovery is to our Higher Power. Knowing that we lack the power to stay clean and find recovery on our own, we enter into a partnership with a Power greater than we are. We make a commitment to live in the care of our Higher Power and, in return, our Higher Power guides us.</p><p>This partnership is vital to staying clean. Making it through the early days of recovery often feels like the hardest thing we&apos;ve ever done. But the strength of our commitment to recovery and the power of God&apos;s care is sufficient to carry us through, just for today.</p><p>Our part in this partnership is to do the very best we can each day, showing up for life and doing what&apos;s put in front of us, applying the principles of recovery to the best of our ability. We promise to do the best we can&151not to fake it, not to pretend to be superhuman, but simply to do the footwork of recovery. In fulfilling our part of the recovery partnership, we experience the care our Higher Power has provided us.</p>

<strong>Just For Today:</strong>
 I will honor my commitment to a partnership with my Higher Power.</p>
